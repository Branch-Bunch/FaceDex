## What it does
Users can run around at events like hackathons taking pictures with all their new friends. Using facial recognition we can uniquely identify anyone in our database, and if they aren't in our database you just caught a new Pokemo.... I mean person! Take a picture of anyone to get their name, social media links etc.

## Inspiration
 Pokemon and being awkward developers.
